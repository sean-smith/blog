---

<p>First download and install the cli with <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=install+pip">pip</a>.</p>

	<p><code class="full">pip install awscli</code></p>

	<p>You'll need a secret key and private key. To get these you'll need to setup a IAM user. Go to <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/users">https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/users</a>.</p>

	<p>Click "Add User". Give it a username "cli" and click "Programmatic Access". On the next screen click "Attach Policy" and search for <code>AdministratorAccess</code>. Attach that Policy and click "Create User".</p>

	<p><code class="full">aws configure</code></p>

	<p>Now you'll have a <code>Access key ID</code> and <code>Secret access key</code>. Enter those when prompted.</p>

<p>That's it!</p>
