	<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span> wanted to make my browser behave more like the developer tools that I know and love. I've become a huge fan of <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish shell</a>, and I use it for things that are traditionally done in the GUI, such as moving and deleting files. That's where the idea to make chrome more like a shell came from.</p>

	<p>Omnibox Alias is the first tool that I've built to "shellify" the browser. It works similar to aliases that you'd put in your <code>.bash_profile</code>, the user first types the keyword <code>go</code> then types the alias that they've set. The browser then goes to the link that corresponds to that alias.</p>

	<p>Programming aliases for common sites saves a few seconds on finding bookmarks or relying on Chrome's history to take you to the correct website.</p>

	<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-chrome-shortcut-ma/ijihchgjhagfhdkhagnmlebpepjlecml">Try it out</a> and let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

	<p>The project is open source! You can contribute <a href="https://github.com/sean-smith/chrome_shortcuts">https://github.com/sean-smith/chrome_shortcuts</a>

	<p>This is the first of many ideas I have in this space so stay tuned for more</p>
