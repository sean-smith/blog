<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span> think we all strive to live more intentionally, but what does that mean? Turns out the ancient greeks have a word for it, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enkrateia">Enkrateia</a> - "power over yourself". </p>

<p>Despite popular belief, we are not born in control of our actions,  making conscious choices over what actions you take is a practice. It requires repetition and does not come easily. Think of this as a fitness routine, at first it's hard and forces you to face <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_(creativity)">the resistance</a> then it becomes easier, pleasurable.</p>

<p>Here's some of the ways to start the practice:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Think Long Term</b> - expand your time horizon to 24-60 months. What does a life in 5 years from now feel like? Where do you live? Who do you associate with? What do you do?
</li>
<li><b>State your intentions></b> - Don't keep them secret! Even if, like me, you think the law of attraction is quite wu - it does ususally keep you doing what you set out to do. By doing this you create external pressure to follow through. This is vital for any habit.</li>
<li><b>Say No</b> - Say no to everything that doesn't contribute to your goals. This is the most important concept because often we get so wrapped up in all the things we **should** do, we don't create the space for the things that are meaningful. BTW, it's ok to have goals such as "see my family more often" or "spend time with people I love" - those aren't the problem.</li>
