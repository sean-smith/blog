title: Hosting a Secure Website on AWS
---

<p><span id="drop_cap">I</span> recently wanted to cut down on the number of EC2 instances I was using and use TLS to make sure everything I write on this blog is served with HTTPS. Having TLS (that's https) was important not because I have confidential information but because I want to ensure authenticity. When you go to <a href="//blog.seanssmith.com">blog.seanssmith.com</a> you are guaranteed that I wrote the posts here.</p>

<p>My initial plan was to host on S3, distribute files out of Cloudfront, and get a free certificate from letsencrypt. I decided to use Amazon Certificate Manager to get free certs instead of letsencrypt. Everything else is the same.</p>

<p>Setting it all up:</p>

<p>I created a bucket called <code>blog.seanssmith.com</code> on S3. Note that the bucket name should be the same name as the website, including subdomains. I'm using blog.seanssmith.com but you should change that to your domain

<p>This can be easily done with the AWS cli. You'll need to have the AWS cli and be authenticated for this to work, if you're not see <a href="setting-up-aws-cli.html">this</a>.</p>

	<p><code class="full">aws s3 mb blog.seanssmith.com</code></p>

	<p><code class="full">aws s3 ls</code></p>

<p>The ls works similar to <code>ls</code> on bash and you should see the bucket you just created listed.</p>

<p>Next create a folder on your local machine (I called mine blog), and add an <code>index.html</code> file:</p>

<p><code class="full">mkdir blog</code></p>

<p><code class="full">cd blog</code></p>

<p><code class="full">echo "Hello World!" > index.html</code></p>

<p>I created a Makefile to deploy my website really easily. Create a makefile and add:

	
<pre><code class="full">deploy:
    aws s3 sync ../blog s3://blog.seanssmith.com \
        --exclude ".git/*" \
        --exclude ".gitignore" \
        --exclude "Makefile" \
        --delete</code></pre>

 <p>Then deploy it!</p>
 <code class="full">make deploy</code>
